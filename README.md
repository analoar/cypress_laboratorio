# [Automation Challenge] - E2E Test Automation by Ana LondoÃ±o

This repository contains the end-to-end (E2E), visual, and accessibility automated tests for the **Laboratorio de Testing** application, written using Cypress.

Credit for the foundational concepts of this project goes to the **Raptor Team** at Huge. The codebase has since been substantially changed and tailored for this particular implementation.

The automation strategy is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpzE6id7MyBNJ2YTJzyqXZsoXabxQS7yQM85XbTY4R4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.5fs1wfkcds7l)

    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:

## Running Tests

You can run the Cypress tests in two modes: interactive (with the Test Runner) or headless (via the command line).

### Interactive Mode

This mode is ideal for developing and debugging tests, as it opens the Cypress Test Runner UI.

```bash
npx cypress open
```

### Headless Mode

This mode is best for running the full test suite in a CI/CD pipeline or for regression runs. It runs the tests in the background without opening a browser window.
```bash
# Run all tests
npx cypress run

# Run tests from a specific file
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/checkout.cy.js"

# Run tests on a specific browser
npx cypress run --browser chrome
```

### Visual Comparison Testing ðŸ“¸
The project uses cypress-image-diff for visual regression testing. The workflow involves running the tests and then generating an HTML report to see the differences.

1. Run the test file 
```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/visual-testing-cypress.cy.js"
``` 

2. Generate the Report
Run the following command to generate the comparison report
```bash
npx cypress-image-diff-html-report generate
``` 

3. View the Report
To start a local server and view the HTML report in your browser, run:
```bash
npx cypress-image-diff-html-report start
````
